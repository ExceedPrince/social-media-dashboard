# social-media-dashboard

This was a solo project in CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

This one of first big projects which had to be created by React. The deign was not my idea, I received az image, which showed me how should this application be look like. 

It wss easy for me to understand, how do the React components work. The hard part was the database. I received a .json file, which had all the data I needed, but that file was badly structured, and it had some mispells. I fixed those issued and successfully was able to fetch through the data.
Those data are static, so there is no a running database behind the scenes, so they will never change by itself. But if someone changes them manually, the numbers will change as well some colors, and the direction of the arrows.

As I mentioned, this project was made with React.
